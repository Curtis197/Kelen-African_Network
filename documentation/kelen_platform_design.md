# Kelen - Platform Design Document

## Core Philosophy

**"One mistake can end your career. Choose your clients. Keep every conversation."**

This is not a review platform. This is a **professional accountability system** where:
- Signals (contract violations) = permanent disqualification
- Recommendations (proven delivery) = career asset
- The standard is perfection, because the stakes are life savings

---

## The Two Completely Separate Systems

### System 1: VALIDATION (Free, Lookup-Only, Permanent)
**What it is:** The truth layer - documented project outcomes

**Access Model: LOOKUP BY NAME ONLY**
- Users can search by EXACT professional name/business name
- Purpose: "Check if someone you're about to work with has signals"
- NOT browsable/discoverable - you must know who you're looking for
- Like checking a criminal record - reactive, not proactive

**Components:**
1. **Recommendations** (positive validation)
   - Former client documents successful project completion
   - Evidence: contract + photos + timeline match
   - Pro can "link" these to their profile (claim ownership)
   - Visible ONLY when someone searches that specific pro's name
   
2. **Signals** (negative validation) 
   - Former client documents contract breach
   - Evidence: contract + photos + timeline divergence
   - Pro CANNOT remove these
   - ONE signal = permanent disqualification
   - Visible ONLY when someone searches that specific pro's name

**Rules:**
- ✅ Always free to submit (users)
- ✅ Always free to lookup by name (public)
- ✅ Always verified before publication
- ❌ Cannot browse/discover professionals (that's Advertisement)
- ❌ Cannot be paid to remove
- ❌ Cannot be paid to hide
- ❌ Cannot be disputed away (only proven false)

**Pro's Role in Validation:**
- Can "link" recommendations to their profile (claim: "this is my work")
- Can respond to signals with counter-evidence (doesn't remove signal)
- Cannot prevent publication of verified evidence
- Profile exists but is NOT discoverable without Advertisement tier

---

### System 2: ADVERTISEMENT (CPM-Based Discovery)

**What it is:** Pay-per-visibility discovery system - completely independent of validation

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Validation = Lookup only** (search by exact name to check - FREE forever)
- **Advertisement = Discovery** (browse, find, be recommended - PAY per view)

---

## The CPM (Cost Per Mille) Model

**Professionals pay €5 per 1000 profile views**

Not subscription. Not monthly fee. **Pay only for actual visibility.**

### How It Works:

1. **Professional adds credit to account:**
   ```
   Deposit €50 → Buy 10,000 profile views
   Deposit €100 → Buy 20,000 profile views
   Deposit €500 → Buy 100,000 profile views
   ```

2. **Set your cap (optional):**
   ```
   Option A: UNCAPPED
   - Profile stays visible until credit runs out
   - Views consume credit automatically
   - When balance hits zero → removed from discovery
   - Can auto-reload to stay visible
   
   Option B: CAPPED (e.g., 5,000 views/month)
   - Profile visible up to cap
   - After 5,000 views → removed from discovery until next month
   - Unused credit rolls over
   - Protects from burning through budget too fast
   ```

3. **Profile appears in discovery:**
   ```
   User searches: "Construction contractors in Abidjan"
   → Pros with active credit appear in results
   → Each profile view = €0.005 deducted from pro's balance
   → 1000 views = €5 deducted
   ```

4. **When credit depletes:**
   ```
   Balance reaches zero →
   - Profile REMOVED from discovery/browse
   - Still VISIBLE if someone searches exact name (validation)
   - Pro gets notification: "Credit depleted, add funds to stay visible"
   - Can reload immediately to resume discovery
   ```

---

## Why CPM Instead of Subscription

### For Professionals:

**Subscription problems:**
- Pay €5/month even if 0 views
- Pay €15/month even if only 500 views
- Can't control spend
- Feels like waste if not converting

**CPM advantages:**
- ✅ Pay ONLY for actual visibility
- ✅ Track exact ROI (€5 per 1000 views)
- ✅ Cap spending if needed
- ✅ Scale spending when converting well
- ✅ Pause anytime without "canceling subscription"

**Example economics for a Gold-status pro:**

```
Scenario: Construction contractor in Abidjan

Monthly visibility:
- 2,000 profile views = €10/month
- 5% click contact button = 100 contacts
- 2% convert to project = 2 new projects
- Average project value = €15,000
- Total new revenue = €30,000

Cost: €10
Revenue: €30,000
ROI: 3000x

Even at 0.1% conversion:
- 2 contacts → maybe 1 project after 6 months
- €15,000 revenue
- €10 cost
- ROI: 1500x
```

**At €5 CPM, if your profile is visible to qualified diaspora, you're profitable even at tiny conversion rates.**

---

## The Filtering Effect (Why €5 CPM Works)

**Not random impressions:**

Views come ONLY from:
- Diaspora actively searching for contractors
- Users browsing Gold-status pros
- People about to invest €20k-100k

**This is qualified traffic:**
- High intent (they're looking for pros NOW)
- High budget (diaspora sending life savings)
- Pre-filtered (only see Gold-status if they want safety)

**Comparison to other advertising:**

```
Google Ads (construction keywords):
- €2-5 per CLICK (not view)
- Random traffic (some just researching)
- Low conversion (<1%)

Facebook Ads (diaspora targeting):
- €10-20 CPM
- General awareness (not high intent)
- Very low conversion (<0.5%)

Kelen:
- €5 per 1000 VIEWS (not clicks)
- Pre-qualified (actively searching for contractors)
- Higher conversion (3-5% likely)
```

**A pro would need to be completely incompetent to not convert 5 projects per year from 10,000 views.**

10,000 views = €50 cost
Even 1 project = €15,000+ revenue
ROI = 300x minimum

---

## Pricing Tiers (Optional Add-Ons)

**Base:** €5 CPM (pay per view)

**Add-ons professionals can buy:**

```
PRIORITY RANKING (+€2 CPM = €7 total):
- Appear higher in search results
- Get views faster
- Worth it for competitive categories

PORTFOLIO SHOWCASE (+€1 CPM = €6 total):
- Unlimited photos (vs 10 on base)
- Video walkthroughs
- Project timeline displays
- Worth it if your work is visually impressive

ANALYTICS PRO (+€50 one-time):
- See viewer countries
- See search terms that found you
- Track contact button clicks
- Conversion funnel
- Worth it once you're spending €100+/month

VERIFICATION BADGE (+€100 one-time):
- Kelen staff verify business registration
- In-person or video verification
- "Verified Business" badge
- Worth it for premium positioning
```

**But core model stays:** €5 CPM, pay only for views, no subscription.

---

## Capping Strategy (Pro's Choice)

### Uncapped (Recommended for Gold-status pros):
```
Strategy: "Let it run until credit depletes"

Advantages:
- Maximize visibility
- Never miss opportunities
- Scale naturally with demand

Risk management:
- Set auto-reload at €20 remaining
- Monitor daily (first month)
- Adjust if burning too fast
```

### Capped (For budget control):
```
Strategy: "Max 2,000 views per month = €10/month"

Advantages:
- Predictable spending
- Can't accidentally overspend
- Good for testing

Disadvantages:
- Miss opportunities if cap hit early
- Seasonal demand variations hurt you
```

**Most Gold pros will run uncapped** because conversion rate is so high that running out of views = leaving money on table.

---

## What Happens When You Run Out

```
Credit balance: €0.05 (10 views remaining)
↓
Next 10 profile views
↓
Balance: €0.00
↓
INSTANT EFFECT:
- Profile removed from "Construction contractors Abidjan" browse
- Profile removed from search suggestions
- Profile removed from category listings
- Email: "Your visibility has ended. Add €20 to resume?"

BUT VALIDATION STILL WORKS:
- Someone searches your exact name → still finds you
- Your Gold status → still visible
- Your recommendations → still visible
- Your signals → still visible (if any)

TO RESUME DISCOVERY:
- Add credit (€20, €50, €100)
- Profile goes live immediately
- Views resume counting
```

**No subscription to cancel. No monthly commitment. Just: credit in = visible, credit out = invisible.**

---

## Platform Revenue Model

```
Conservative Year 1 Projection:

500 active pros
Average spend: €20/month (4,000 views each)
↓
500 × €20 = €10,000/month revenue
€120,000/year

Optimistic Year 1:
2,000 active pros  
Average spend: €30/month (6,000 views each)
↓
2,000 × €30 = €60,000/month revenue
€720,000/year

Year 2-3 (scale):
10,000 active pros
Average spend: €50/month
↓
€500,000/month revenue
€6M/year
```

**Why pros will spend more over time:**
- Initial test: €10-20/month
- See conversion: increase to €50-100/month
- Competition increases: some go €200+/month
- Geographic expansion: serve multiple cities

---

## The Perfect Incentive Alignment

### Gold-status pros:
- WANT visibility (it converts)
- Happy to pay €5 CPM (profitable)
- Increase spend as they convert
- Platform makes money when they make money

### Red-status pros:
- DON'T want visibility (exposes signals)
- Won't pay (would hurt them)
- Self-select out
- Platform doesn't make money from bad actors

### Grey-status pros:
- MIGHT pay small amounts to test
- Build recommendations organically
- Graduate to Gold → then spend more
- Healthy growth path

**The CPM model naturally filters quality without any editorial control.**

---

---

## The Three Status Tiers (Validation-Based)

### 🟢 GOLD STATUS (Clean Record)
**Criteria:**
- At least 3 verified recommendations
- ZERO signals
- All linked projects completed as contracted

**Display:**
```
✓ CLEAN RECORD
  8 verified projects completed
  0 signals
  Recommended for diaspora investment
```

**What this means:**
- This pro has never breached a contract on record
- Every project was delivered as promised
- Safe for life-savings investment

---

### 🔴 RED STATUS (Flagged)
**Criteria:**
- ONE or more verified signals
- Regardless of recommendation count
- Permanent status (cannot be removed)

**Display:**
```
⚠️ SIGNALS ON RECORD
   Not recommended for diaspora investment
   
   11 verified recommendations
   2 verified signals
   
   This professional has documented contract breaches.
   While they have successful projects, the presence of
   any signal indicates unacceptable risk for diaspora investment.
   
   [View signal details]
```

**What this means:**
- Contract breaches documented
- Permanently disqualified for diaspora work
- May still work locally, but not through Kelen
- No amount of good work erases this

---

### ⚪ GREY STATUS (Unverified)
**Criteria:**
- No recommendations yet
- No signals yet
- Unknown quantity

**Display:**
```
⚪ UNVERIFIED
   No track record on Kelen
   
   This professional has not yet completed
   verified projects through the platform.
   
   Proceed with extreme caution.
   Use Kelen's escrow/monitoring services if proceeding.
```

---

## The Two User Journeys

### Journey 1: CHECKING (Free - Validation System)

**User story:**
"Someone recommended Kouadio Construction to me. Before I send €50k, I want to check if they have any signals."

**Flow:**
1. Go to Kelen.com
2. Search: "Kouadio Construction" (exact name)
3. See profile with validation status:
   - Gold: 8 recommendations, 0 signals ✓
   - Red: 3 recommendations, 2 signals ⚠️
   - Grey: No track record ⚪
4. Make decision

**Cost:** FREE (this is the protection layer)

**What you learn:**
- Has this pro ever breached a contract on record?
- How many verified projects have they completed?
- What do the signals say (if any)?

**What you DON'T get:**
- Discovery of other pros
- Contact information (unless pro pays for Advertisement)
- Comparison shopping

---

### Journey 2: DISCOVERING (CPM-Based Visibility)

**User story:**
"I need a construction contractor in Abidjan. I don't know anyone. I want to find Gold-status professionals."

**Flow:**
1. Go to Kelen.com
2. Browse: "Construction contractors in Abidjan"
3. See list of professionals who have ACTIVE CREDIT (paying €5 per 1000 views)
4. Filter by:
   - Gold status only (0 signals)
   - Number of recommendations
   - Location
   - Specialty
5. View portfolios, contact info
6. Choose one
7. **(Behind the scenes: Pro gets charged €0.005 for this profile view)**

**Cost for USER:** FREE (browsing)
**Cost for PRO:** €5 per 1000 profile views (only when visible)

**What you get:**
- Vetted list of professionals
- All have validation history (Gold/Red/Grey)
- Contact info, portfolios, analytics
- Can compare multiple pros

---

## Why This Split Is Brilliant

### For Users (Diaspora):
**Checking is free forever:**
- Protects against known scammers
- Validates referrals from family/friends
- No barrier to verification

**Discovery is also free:**
- Browse Gold-status pros
- Find professionals when you have no contacts
- Compare options

**User never pays** - platform is fully accessible for protection

---

### For Professionals:

**Validation is free:**
- Build Gold status without paying
- Respond to signals without paying
- Exist in the system
- Be checkable by name

**Discovery requires payment:**
- If you want NEW clients who don't know you yet
- If you want to be found in browsing/search
- If you want contact info visible
- If you want portfolio showcased

**This creates perfect incentive:**
- Good pros with Gold status WANT to pay (worth it for discovery)
- Bad pros with Red status DON'T pay (visibility would hurt them)
- Grey pros (new) might pay to bootstrap reputation

---

### Why This Beats Every Other Model

**Compared to Yelp/Google Reviews:**
- Kelen: Validation free, Discovery paid
- Yelp: Everything free, cluttered with low-quality listings
- Result: Kelen's paid tier = quality filter

**Compared to LinkedIn Premium:**
- Kelen: Users never pay, pros pay for discovery
- LinkedIn: Users pay for visibility
- Result: Kelen aligns incentives (pros serve users, not vice versa)

**Compared to Traditional Marketplaces:**
- Kelen: Validation separate from monetization
- Marketplaces: Everything tied to payment
- Result: Kelen's validation is credible (can't be bought)

---

### The Western Country Problem

You're absolutely right: **This platform doesn't exist even in Western countries, where it desperately should.**

**Blue collar scams in France/UK/US:**
- Electricians who never finish
- Plumbers who damage more than they fix  
- Builders who abandon mid-project
- Roofers who take deposits and disappear

**Yet they continue working because:**
- Reviews are subjective ("maybe just a difficult client")
- Bad reviews get buried by fake good reviews
- New business name every few years
- No permanent accountability system
- Legal action is expensive/slow

**Kelen's model would destroy this in ANY market:**
- One verified contract breach = career over
- Can't hide behind new business names (personal identity linked)
- Can't dilute with fake reviews (evidence required)
- Can't pay to remove (validation is free/permanent)

### Why It Works for Diaspora First

**Lower barriers to launch:**
- Diaspora already desperate for solution (€50k at stake)
- Scam rate higher (enforcement weaker)
- Social proof spreads faster (tight communities)
- Fewer legal complexities (operating in African jurisdiction initially)

**But the model is universal:**
- Any market where contract breaches are common
- Any market where one-time clients can't verify reputation
- Any market where stakes are high (renovations, construction, eldercare)

### The Philosophical Core

**In Western countries:**
"Everyone deserves a second chance"
"Businesses learn from mistakes"
"Balance the feedback"

**Kelen's philosophy:**
"Not when you're handling someone's life savings"
"Not when legal recourse doesn't exist"
"Not when the asymmetry is this extreme"

**This is not cruelty - this is appropriate gravity.**

---

## How "Linking" Recommendations Works

Since recommendations are submitted by clients, not pros, pros must **claim/link** them:

### Process:

1. **Client submits recommendation:**
   ```
   Former client: "I worked with Kouadio Construction"
   Evidence: Contract, completion photos, timeline
   Project: House in Abidjan, completed Dec 2024
   ```

2. **Recommendation goes to verification queue**
   - Kelen staff verify evidence exists
   - Verify contract is legitimate
   - Verify photos match project description

3. **Recommendation published (unlinked state):**
   ```
   ✓ VERIFIED RECOMMENDATION
     Project: Residential construction, Abidjan
     Completed: December 2024
     Contractor mentioned: "Kouadio Construction"
     
     [Not yet linked to verified profile]
   ```

4. **Pro can claim/link it:**
   ```
   Kouadio Construction logs in →
   See notification: "Recommendation mentions your business"
   Click "Link to my profile"
   Provide business verification (registration docs)
   
   → Recommendation now appears on their profile
   → Count increases: "4 verified recommendations"
   ```

### Why This System Works:

**Prevents fake recommendations:**
- Client submits first (with evidence)
- Pro can only claim what clients submitted
- Can't create recommendations for themselves

**Builds Gold status organically:**
- Each real project completion = potential recommendation
- Pro must maintain client relationships (they need them to submit)
- Natural incentive for quality work

**Allows pros to "opt in":**
- Recommendation exists even if pro doesn't claim it
- But claiming it builds their Gold status
- Unclaimed recommendations = lost opportunity

## The Career-Defining Choice

Your phrase: **"One mistake can kill your career. Choose your clients. Keep every conversation."**

This becomes the platform's explicit warning to professionals:

### Landing Page for Professionals:

---

**"Before You Join Kelen"**

This platform operates under a single principle:

**One verified contract breach ends your Kelen career permanently.**

Not "damages your reputation."
Not "requires explanation."

**Ends. Your. Career.**

Why this standard?

Because you're asking for access to diaspora life savings.
Money earned through years of sacrifice in foreign countries.
Money that cannot be recovered if you fail.

**The choice is yours:**

✓ Don't work with diaspora clients
  → Don't join Kelen
  → Continue working locally
  → No risk to you

✓ Work with diaspora clients
  → Join Kelen
  → Accept perfection as the standard
  → Build a Gold record that becomes your most valuable asset

**If you choose to join:**

- Choose your clients carefully (you have the right to refuse)
- Keep every message, every photo, every conversation
- Deliver exactly what you promise, when you promise
- Understand that one failure = permanent disqualification

**This is not unfair.**

This is the appropriate standard when someone entrusts you with everything they have.

---

### Why Professionals Will Accept This

**Because the upside is massive:**

A Gold-status professional on Kelen:
- Gets pre-qualified diaspora clients (serious, funded)
- Can charge premium prices (scarcity of clean records)
- Builds an asset (reputation that follows them)
- Reduces acquisition costs (clients find them)
- Works with motivated clients (they want success)

**The choice architecture:**

```
Option A: Don't join Kelen
- Keep working locally
- Lower prices
- Local competition
- No permanent record (good or bad)

Option B: Join Kelen, take it seriously
- Access diaspora money
- Premium pricing
- Permanent Gold status (career asset)
- But ONE mistake = permanent Red status

Option C: Join Kelen, don't take it seriously
- Get one or two diaspora clients
- Breach contract
- Get signal
- Permanent Red status
- Worse than Option A
```

Rational professionals choose A or B, never C.

---

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Validation System (Free, Core)
**Week 1-2:**
- Recommendation submission form (evidence required)
- Signal submission form (evidence required)  
- Manual verification queue (you review)
- Static profile pages (Gold/Red/Grey display)

**Week 3-4:**
- Pro authentication (claim profiles)
- "Link recommendation" flow
- Signal response system (doesn't remove signal)
- Public search/browse

**No payment, no tiers, no ads yet.**

Just prove validation works.

---

### Phase 2: Advertisement System (Paid, Optional)
**Month 2-3:**
- Free vs Standard vs Premium tiers
- Payment integration (Stripe for EUR, Wave/Orange Money for CFA)
- Enhanced profile features (portfolio, analytics)
- Search ranking based on tier

**Messaging:**
"Payment improves visibility. It never changes validation status."

---

### Phase 3: Scale & Enforcement
**Month 4-6:**
- Professional moderation team
- Dispute resolution process
- False signal penalties
- Geographic expansion (Senegal, Cameroon, Mali)

---

## Why This Will Work (And Spread)

### In Africa/Diaspora First:
- Desperate need (€50k losses common)
- Weak legal recourse
- Tight communities (word spreads fast)
- High trust premium (Gold status worth a lot)

### Then Western Countries:
- Same problems exist (contractor scams)
- Higher legal standards (easier to operate)
- Wealthier clients (willing to pay for verification)
- Bigger market (millions of home renovations/year)

**Kelen becomes:**
- The global standard for high-stakes contract work
- A career-defining certification (Gold status)
- A permanent accountability system

---

   - Primary: kelen.com (you confirmed it's available)
   - Backup: kelen.africa (if .com fails)
   - Register immediately before building anything

2. **Manual validation test:**
   - Find 5 people with completed projects (good experiences)
   - Find 3 people with breached contracts (bad experiences)
   - Collect evidence from both
   - Create static HTML showing:
     - Lookup search (by exact name)
     - Gold vs Red vs Grey profiles
     - What signals look like with evidence
   - Show to 20 diaspora members
   - Ask: "Would you check here before sending money?"

3. **Build MVP - Two-Track Development:**

   **Track A: Validation System (Priority 1 - Week 1-2)**
   - Name lookup search (exact match only)
   - Professional profile page (Gold/Red/Grey display)
   - Recommendation submission form (with evidence upload)
   - Signal submission form (with evidence upload)
   - Manual verification queue (you review evidence)

**Does this correctly capture the complete philosophy and structure?**

The key separation: Validation (free/permanent/immutable) vs Advertisement (paid/optional/separate)?
